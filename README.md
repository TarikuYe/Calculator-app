## 🌓 Night Mode

- Easily switch between light and dark themes using the `Dark` toggle.
- Smooth transitions and eye-friendly interface for night usage.

---

## 📐 Degree vs Radian Support

- Toggle `RAD` switch to choose between:
  - **Degrees** (default): Trig functions take degrees (`sin(30)` → `0.5`)
  - **Radians**: Use `RAD` toggle to convert mode internally for `Math.sin`, `Math.cos`, etc.
